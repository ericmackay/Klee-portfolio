  <div class='about-content'>
    <p>Klee Larsen Crawford is a Vancouver based visual artist, inspired by horizon lines in nature. Klee loves to combine old
      and new technologies by using film and then digitalizing the image. Working with film gives Klee her favourite end
      result of grain from high speed film and being able to work with a large negative. Painting has become a part of her
      practice and you can find her in her studio at 1000 Parker Street.</p>
    <p>Her current practice of mixed media combines her love of photography and painting to create a cohesive, dreamy and moody
      end result. Klee uses a medium format film camera and prints the image on a transparent paper. She then layers the
      image overtop of paint, silver and gold leaf to create depth and texture. The finished piece is then sealed with a
      resin finish. Each end result is an original and because of her process no two will ever be the same. </p>
    <p> Klee is motivated by creating images that intrigue her audience through their mysterious process. She feels a sense of success
    when her viewer questions if the work is a photograph or a painting. People’s reaction to these mysterious pieces motivates
    her to come up with original and unique work while using classic technique and subject matter. Klee feels complete as
    an artist when her audience can relive a memory or experience.</p>
